description: "Puck of Pook's Hill is a fantasy book by Rudyard Kipling, published\
  \ in 1906, containing a series of short stories set in different periods of English\
  \ history. It can count both as historical fantasy – since some of the stories told\
  \ of the past have clear magical elements, and as contemporary fantasy – since it\
  \ depicts a magical being active and practising his magic in the England of the\
  \ early 1900s when the book was written.\nThe stories are all narrated to two children\
  \ living near Burwash, in the area of Kipling's own house Bateman's, by people magically\
  \ plucked out of history by the elf Puck, or told by Puck himself. (Puck, who refers\
  \ to himself as \"the oldest Old Thing in England\", is better known as a character\
  \ in William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream.) The genres of particular\
  \ stories range from authentic historical novella (A Centurion of the Thirtieth,\
  \ On the Great Wall) to children's fantasy (Dymchurch Flit). Each story is bracketed\
  \ by a poem which relates in some manner to the theme or subject of the story.\n\
  Donald Mackenzie, who wrote the introduction for the Oxford World's Classics edition\
  \ of Puck of Pook's Hill in 1987, has described this book as an example of archaeological\
  \ imagination that, in fragments, delivers a look at the history of England, climaxing\
  \ with the signing of Magna Carta.\nPuck calmly concludes the series of stories:\
  \ \"Weland gave the Sword, The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the\
  \ Law. It's as natural as an oak growing.\"\nThe stories originally appeared in\
  \ the Strand Magazine in 1906 with illustrations by Claude Allen Shepperson, but\
  \ the first book-form edition was illustrated by H. R. Millar. Arthur Rackham provided\
  \ four colour plates for the first US edition. Puck of Pook's Hill was followed\
  \ four years later by a second volume, Rewards and Fairies, featuring the same children\
  \ in the following summer.\nT. S. Eliot included several of the poems in his 1941\
  \ collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
